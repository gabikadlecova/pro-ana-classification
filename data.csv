2_0,0,i had a long battle with anorexia
3_0,0," those thoughts telling me that if i just lost x amount of weight that i would have achieved, that i may be able to accept treatment, finally feel like i deserved it"
4_0,0,the trouble is that never happened
5_0,0, there was never a magic number
6_0,0, it was never enough
7_0,0, whatever i did anorexia would still scream in my ear and make my mind feel like it was going to explode
8_0,0,"i chased those thoughts and followed those feelings, aiming for perfection, to feel like i had achieved something that would finally make me feel okay"
9_0,0, to reach an impossible goal that would finally allow me to eat again
10_0,0,those thoughts landed me with one day care and three inpatient admissions
11_0,0,"i thought i would never get well, that these thoughts would never go away"
12_0,0, there was no way i was ever going to be able to have a normal relationship with food and i was going to be fighting this forever
13_0,0, it felt like nothing was helping
14_0,0, nothing and no one could seemingly help me to beat anorexia
15_0,0, recovery seemed like it was something that happened to other people
16_0,0,"i wanted to write this to say that if this sounds like you, if this is how you feel then it’s okay! it’s okay to think these things – with what you are currently fighting it is totally understandable"
17_0,0," however, it’s not true"
18_0,0," these are the thoughts of anorexia playing with your mind, making you feel hopeless"
19_0,0, i thought these things too and now i am nearly 10 years recovered from anorexia
20_0,0,i soon learned that rushing recovery was one thing that was stopping me from recovering
21_0,0, i was trying to be not only perfect within anorexia but also to have a perfect recovery – both unreachable goals
22_0,0,each time i left hospital at a “normal weight” with the “well done”s and “look how far you’ve come”s i felt like i should be recovered; i thought that was what everyone thought
23_0,0, sadly it is thought by some that if you are a “normal” weight then you must be anorexia free
24_0,0, this is simply not the case
25_0,0, anorexia drives the symptoms and behaviours from the mind
26_0,0, the mind is where the issues are regardless of weight
27_0,0,"i learned to talk, to think about my life, including the things that i really didn’t want to think or talk about, to realise why i felt that my life was out of control and why i found it so hard to let the anorexia go"
28_0,0," i learned to take it at my pace, to push against the anorexic thoughts little by little, and the more i did, the less power they had over time"
29_0,0,i let people in more who were trying to help as i had a terrible knack of pushing them away and so i slowly learned to try to do that less
30_0,0,it was a long process and it most definitely wasn’t perfect
31_0,0, i still have times where i spend too long looking in the mirror analysing my stomach with those familiar thoughts washing over me and it’s still horrible when that happens
32_0,0," the difference however is they come in waves and then they generally wash away without me being affected, i have learned to deal with them and recognise that voice for what it is, and i have learned not to listen to the extent i did"
33_0,0," consequently 99% of the time i live totally free from anorexia and any related behaviours, and any that do occur are minor thoughts that come and go"
34_0,0,"if you are reading this thinking this will never be you, please know that i thought this too"
35_0,0, i thought that recovery was something that other extraordinary beings did and i would never get there
36_0,0, i am approximately 10 years free from anorexia and its pull has got less each year that has passed
37_0,0, you can do this too
38_0,0, it is possible
39_0,0," small steps, one foot in front of the other and aiming for progress not perfection"
40_0,0,"i now blog and help others in relation to mental health issues and am very passionate about raising awareness on mental health issues, particularly anorexia"

44_0,0,i have learnt to rest in times of struggle and no
45_0,0,you deserve to no longer be suffering from such a
46_0,0,"beat would like to keep you informed about our work, fundraising activities, and campaigns"
47_0,0,"recovery from an eating disorder can be a long process that requires not only a qualified team of professionals, but also the love and support of family and friends"
48_0,0, it is not uncommon for someone who suffers with an eating disorder to feel uncertain about their progress or for their loved-ones to feel disengaged from the treatment process
49_0,0," these potential roadblocks may lead to feelings of ambivalence, limited progress, and treatment drop out"
50_0,0," therefore, knowing about the stages of change model, as defined by prochaska and diclemente, will help everyone involved better negotiate the road to recovery"
51_0,0,the stages of change in the process of recovery from an eating disorder are a cycle rather than a linear progression
52_0,0, the person may go through this cycle more than one time or may need to revisit a particular stage before moving on to the next
53_0,0, they may also go through the stages for each individual eating disorder symptom
54_0,0," in other words, if they are recovering from anorexia, they could be in the action stage for restrictive eating (e"
55_0,0,", eating three meals a day along with snacks, engaging in social eating, and utilizing support system) while, at the same time, they could be going through the contemplation stage for body image and weight concerns (e"
56_0,0,", becoming aware of how body image is tied to self-esteem and self-worth, defining oneself as a body or number, and identifying the negatives of striving for the ""perfect body"")"
57_0,0, this is precisely why recovery from an eating disorder is complex and individualized
58_0,0,the table below is a general breakdown of the stages of change for someone who is recovering from an eating disorder
59_0,0," if you are a parent or friend of someone struggling, you no doubt suffer right along with them, so it is crucial for you to pay attention to your own needs as well as be present for your child or friend during her recovery process"
60_0,0,"there are five stages of change that occur in the recovery processpre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance"
61_0,0,the pre-contemplation stage is evident when a person does not believe they have a problem
62_0,0," close family and friends are bound to pick up on symptoms such as restrictive eating, the binge/purge cycle, or a preoccupation with weight, shape, and appearance even before the individual admits to it"
63_0,0, they may refuse to discuss the topic and deny they need help
64_0,0," at this stage, it is necessary to gently educate the individual about the devastating effects the disorder will have on their health and life, and the positive aspects of change"
65_0,0,do not be in denial of your child or friend’s eating disorder
66_0,0,be aware of the signs and symptoms
67_0,0,avoid rationalizing their eating disordered behaviors
68_0,0,openly share your thoughts and concerns with your child or loved one
69_0,0,the contemplation stage occurs when an individual is willing to admit that they have a problem and are now open to receiving help
70_0,0," the fear of change may be very strong, and it is during this phase that a psychotherapist should assist the individual in discovering the function of their eating disorder so they can understand why it is in their life and how it no longer serves them"
71_0,0," this, in turn, helps the individual move closer toward the next stage of change"
72_0,0,"if your child is under the age of 18, insist that they receive professional help from a qualified eating disorder specialist"
73_0,0,educate yourself about the disorder
74_0,0,be a good listener
75_0,0,"do not try to ""fix"" the problem yourself"
76_0,0,seek your own encouragement from a local eating disorder support group for family and friends
77_0,0,"the person transitions into the preparation stage when they are ready to change, but are uncertain about how to do it"
78_0,0," time is spent establishing specific coping skills such as appropriate boundary setting and assertiveness, effective ways of dealing with negative eating disorder thoughts and emotions, and ways to tend to their personal needs"
79_0,0, potential barriers to change are identified
80_0,0," this is usually when a plan of action is developed by the treatment team, (i"
81_0,0," psychotherapist, nutritionist, and physician) as well as the individual and designated family members"
82_0,0, this generally includes a list of people to call during times of crisis
83_0,0,"if supporting a loved one in their recovery, identify what your role is in the recovery process"
84_0,0,"explore your own thoughts and beliefs about food, weight, shape, and appearance"
85_0,0,ask your child/loved one and the treatment team how you can be best involved in the recovery process and what you can do to be supportive
86_0,0,the action stage begins when the person is ready to implement their strategy and confront the eating disorder behavior head on
87_0,0," at this point, they are open to trying new ideas and behaviors, and are willing to face fears in order for change to occur"
88_0,0, trusting the treatment team and their support network is essential to making the action stage successful
89_0,0,follow the treatment team’s recommendations
90_0,0,"remove triggers from your environmentno diet foods, no scales, and no stress"
91_0,0,"be warm and caring, yet appropriate and determined with boundaries, rules, and guidelines"
92_0,0,"reinforce positive changes without focusing on weight, shape, or appearance"
93_0,0,the maintenance stage evolves when the person has sustained the action stage for approximately six months or longer
94_0,0," during this period, they actively practice new behaviors and new ways of thinking as well as consistently use both healthy self-care and coping skills"
95_0,0," part of this stage also includes revisiting potential triggers in order to prevent relapse, establishing new areas of interests, and beginning to live their life in a meaningful way"
96_0,0,applaud your loved one’s efforts and successes
97_0,0,continue to adjust to new developments
98_0,0,redefine the boundaries at home as necessary
99_0,0,maintain positive communications
100_0,0,be aware of possible recovery backsliding
101_0,0,the termination stage & relapse prevention
102_0,0, relapse is sometimes grouped with the maintenance stage since recovery in nonlinear and it is not uncommon to return to old behaviors during the overall recovery process
103_0,0,"to prevent relapsing do not forget to ask for help, communicate your thoughts and feelings, address and resolve problems as they arise, live a healthful and balanced life, and remember that you would not have made it this far if it were not for your strong determination and dedication toward recovery"
104_0,0,"eating disorders are complex mental illnesses, caused by a combination of environmental, biological, and psychological factors"
105_0,0," while our environment is only a part of the equation, it is important to look at the ways it does contribute, and what we can do to change it"
106_0,0,we are constantly bombarded with the message “thinner is better
107_0,0,"” our casual conversations about weight loss, unrealistic expectations portrayed in the media, and diet culture are all environmental factors that can contribute to body image issues, and in some instances, eating disorders"
108_0,0, most of us hear comments like “i had a huge lunch–i’ll need to work that off later!” or “i look so fat” on a daily basis
109_0,0," additionally, we’re exposed to social media highlight reels (often featuring very carefully shot and edited photos), diet ads, and hollywood’s worship of people who are one very specific body type every time we reach for our screens"
110_0,0,it’s so pervasive that it can almost feel like background noise
111_0,0, and that’s insidious because these messages filter into our collective consciousness without our knowledge
112_0,0," but that doesn’t mean it’s right, and it doesn’t mean it should be normalized"
113_0,0," fortunately, we are starting to see more and more pressure on media outlets to be inclusive of all shapes and sizes, to eliminate the use of photoshop to alter bodies and to stop encouraging unhealthy body standards for actors and models"
114_0,0, change is happening slowly but surely
115_0,0,"but what can we, as individuals, do to change our environment right now? how can we promote a healthier environment, as well as support loved ones who may be struggling with an eating disorder? changing the way we talk about food, weight, and body image is a great place to start"
116_0,0,talk less about food and weight
117_0,0," avoid making comments about a person’s dietary habits and intake, including a person’s weight and physical appearance"
118_0,0," instead, do more to make the environment one in which it is easier to make choices that are conducive to health"
119_0,0,losing weight does not necessarily mean improving health
120_0,0," focus on giving people positive feedback for behavior changes and improvement in self-esteem and self-image, not weight"
121_0,0,model the behavior
122_0,0," advocate physical activity because it feels good, gives energy, and helps to relieve stress"
123_0,0," encourage a variety of foods to get a variety of nutrients, but don’t villainize “junk foods” as off-limits"
124_0,0,"keep the focus on overall health, not weight"
125_0,0, encourage people to share the benefits of healthy behavior changes as opposed to weight loss
126_0,0,ensure people know they have value regardless of their weight or health status
127_0,0, low self-esteem is common in those who struggle with weight or obesity (and also those of normal weight)
128_0,0, ask what a person feels good about and reinforce those good feelings
129_0,0,encourage language change about others’ weight and your own
130_0,0, commenting negatively or positively about weight can set people up for eating disorders and obesity in the future
131_0,0,support media outlets and entertainers that promote body acceptance

146_0,0,i’ve been thinking for a while about writing a post about my experiences travelling and living overseas with a history of disordered eating and a complex relationship with food and exercise
147_0,0," i find writing a great therapy and i wanted to share some of my experiences to hopefully encourage others to follow their dreams and not let their eating disorder get in the way of travelling, moving out of home, going to university or any other dreams that currently feel unachievable"
148_0,0," i want to stress that if you’re not ready for this kind of step in your recovery, you are doing great and i hope this serves as an encouragement to you too"
149_0,0,i’ve been living in australia since october 2018 on a one year working holiday visa and am about to start my regional farm work to extend to a second year visa
150_0,0, when i left england i was looking forward to a change but i knew that my eating disorder would be boarding the plane with me and i think this is really important to noteyou can’t run away from it
151_0,0," i was confident i could do this and i was in a really good place with my relationship with food, but there were still challenges and i have struggled at times, particularly when there’s been a lack of routine, stress and unfamiliar foods"
152_0,0," i’d recently become a pescetarian for a number of reasons, one of which was to have more control over food whilst i was travelling"
153_0,0," i went on a week surf camp and a number of other trips where meals were provided, and being on the ‘dietary requirements’ list really helped me to regulate exactly what i was eating and gave me that added comfort that i would be happy with what was provided"
154_0,0, i’ve eaten some of the best veggie burgers in the history of the universe and it’s given me the confidence to try new foods too
155_0,0," i’ve learnt to exercise when i can, but it doesn’t dictate my life anymore"
156_0,0," in the uk, i can see now that i was over-exercising and arranging work and socials around when i could go for a run or fit in the gym"
157_0,0," now i’ve learnt to be more flexible and do what i want when i can, but there’s no stress if it doesn’t work out"
158_0,0," i’ve also discovered new ways to work out, like surfing and indoor rock climbing, because they’re fun and not because i feel the need to be exercising"
159_0,0,tip #1familiarise yourself with the local supermarkets and find your safe foods
160_0,0," it took me a while to find comforting (and affordable) meals and snacks that i could cook and eat, particularly when i was living in hostels and constantly on the move"
161_0,0," culinary norms in australia are almost identical to that of the uk, which helped a lot and was a factor in deciding on australia"
162_0,0, they have different brands and an even more diverse range of foods on offer than in the uk
163_0,0," i generally find choice overwhelming so it helped to just focus on the foods i knew i would eat at first before branching out to new things, which i have done and have found some delicious foods that i now love and they have even become new safe foods"
164_0,0," also, stock up if you’ll be away from the shops for a while, i always had a designated food bag when i went travelling"
165_0,0,tip #2tell people
166_0,0," i didn’t want to make it a big deal by telling anyone, but that soon meant i was struggling on my own"
167_0,0, i remember the first new friend i told in sydney about my eating disorder and it felt like a huge weight had been lifted
168_0,0, it wasn’t a secret anymore! she was so kind and asked me how she could help
169_0,0," don’t hide – like i said, you aren’t running away from your problems, so don’t pretend that you’re all good when really telling someone will most likely help rather than hinder"
170_0,0," it takes a while to build up that trust with new friends, i know, but it’s worth it when you can share, be understood and helped"
171_0,0, you can still share your struggles with friends back home too – you may feel a million miles away but true friends will be there for you wherever you are
172_0,0, i had good friends back in the uk leaving me voice note suggestions of easy meals i could cook when i was struggling and that really helped
173_0,0,tip #3breathe
174_0,0," i find being spontaneous a challenge sometimes, which i try to spin as a positive thing, a test to overcome, but it’s also okay not to be okay"
175_0,0, i’ve encountered a few spontaneous suggestions for ‘grabbing food out’ that have freaked me out
176_0,0," it didn’t fit in with my plan, i had safe food at home i wanted, i’d ‘allowed’ myself to eat out once this week already, or my personal favourite, i haven’t looked up the menu online! breathe"
177_0,0, take a breath and stop
178_0,0, it’ll be okay
179_0,0, it’s easier said than done but try to think rationally
180_0,0, you can say no and that’s fine
181_0,0," it’s a lot harder to go for it and challenge yourself, but it’s a great opportunity to overcome a problem and the chance to celebrate a victory"
182_0,0," in some cases, this situation could have been a lot easier if i’d listened to tip #2 and just told these friends in the first place"
183_0,0, something to work on
184_0,0,tip #4 remember the truths
185_0,0, food is fuel
186_0,0, you need fuel for energy
187_0,0," you need energy to walk, to explore, to run, to sit, to read, to talk, to think, to write, to climb, to work and to sleep"
188_0,0, no matter what you’re doing with your day you need to eat and you can eat whatever you want
189_0,0," remember why you’ve come here, what you’ve achieved so far and what’s to come on this adventure"
190_0,0,so i met this guy
191_0,0," travelling aside, telling a potential partner about your eating disorder is a big deal and i was extremely embarrassed, anxious and just sick to the stomach about telling him"
192_0,0, where do you start? bleurgh! eventually i got it all out in the open and he was really great and totally understanding
193_0,0," however, it was humbling to realise that even when someone accepts you as you are, flaws and all, that doesn’t automatically make everything better"
194_0,0," i’d always thought i would suddenly feel great about myself, completely body confident, no need to stress about food anymore, and all the negative voices in my head would be defeated and just pack up and leave"
195_0,0," let’s be realistic, eating disorders are a bit more complicated than that"
196_0,0,"i will probably always have a complex relationship with food, something that flares up in certain situations and times of stress, but i’m in control and not the eating disorder"
197_0,0," in fact, as a christian i would say god is in control, and he gives me the strength to be in control and knowledge that i am loved unconditionally regardless of anything that i deem a flaw"
198_0,0," with that, i can confidently continue to work, live, travel and eat in australia or anywhere in the world"

207_0,0," how do i begin recovery from an eating disorder?the inner voices of anorexia and bulimia whisper that you’ll never be happy until you lose weight, that your worth is measured by how you look"
208_0,0, but the truth is that happiness and self-esteem come from loving yourself for who you truly are—and that’s only possible with recovery
209_0,0,the road to recovery from an eating disorder starts with admitting you have a problem
210_0,0," this admission can be tough, especially if you’re still clinging to the belief—even in the back of your mind—that weight loss is the key to your happiness, confidence, and success"
211_0,0," even when you finally understand this isn’t true, old habits are still hard to break"
212_0,0,the good news is that the behaviors you’ve learned can also be unlearned
213_0,0," just as anyone can develop an eating disorder, so too, anyone can get better"
214_0,0," however, overcoming an eating disorder is about more than giving up unhealthy eating behaviors"
215_0,0," it’s also about learning new ways to cope with emotional pain and rediscovering who you are beyond your eating habits, weight, and body image"
216_0,0,true recovery from an eating disorder involves learning to:listen to your feelings
217_0,0,listen to your body
218_0,0,accept yourself
219_0,0,love yourself
220_0,0,"this may seem like a lot to tackle, but just remember that you’re not alone"

224_0,0," it can feel scary or embarrassing to seek help for an eating disorder, so it’s important to choose someone who will be supportive and truly listen without judging you or rejecting you"
225_0,0," this could be a close friend or family member or a youth leader, teacher, or school counselor you trust"
226_0,0, or you may be more comfortable confiding in a therapist or doctor
227_0,0,choose the right time and place
228_0,0, there are no hard and fast rules for telling someone about your eating disorder
229_0,0, but be mindful about choosing the right time and place—ideally somewhere private where you won’t be rushed or interrupted
230_0,0,starting the conversation
231_0,0, this can be the hardest part
232_0,0," one way to start is by simply saying, “i’ve got something important to tell you"
233_0,0," it’s difficult for me to talk about this, so it would mean a lot if you’d be patient and hear me out"
234_0,0,"” from there, you may want to talk about when your eating disorder started, the feelings, thoughts, and behaviors involved, and how the disorder has impacted you"
235_0,0,be patient
236_0,0, your friend or family member will have their own emotional reaction to learning about your eating disorder
237_0,0," they may feel shocked, helpless, confused, sad, or even angry"
238_0,0, they may not know how to respond or help you
239_0,0, give them time to digest what you’re telling them
240_0,0, it’s also important to educate them about your specific eating disorder
241_0,0,be specific about how the person can best support you
242_0,0," for example, you may want them to help you find treatment, accompany you to see a doctor, check in with you regularly about how you’re feeling, or find some other way of supporting your recovery (without turning into the food police)"
243_0,0,"eating disorder support groupswhile family and friends can be a huge help in providing support, you may also want to join an eating disorder support group"
244_0,0, they provide a safe environment where you can talk freely about your eating disorder and get advice and support from people who know what you’re going through
245_0,0,there are many types of eating disorder support groups
246_0,0," some are led by professional therapists, while others are moderated by trained volunteers or people who have recovered from an eating disorder"

699_0,0, janssen goes on to explain that eating disorders in mid-adulthood can sometimes be attributed to fad diets
700_0,0, some men and women will try just about anything to control their weight as their bodies undergo natural changes as they grow older
701_0,0," years of yo-yo dieting and jumping on the latest fad diet train can lead to eating disorders like binge eating disorder, which commonly develops later in life (during early adulthood as opposed to a person’s teen years)"
702_0,0," also, binge eating disorder in older adults can be tough to pinpoint as an eating disorder because many of the symptoms of the disorder are done privately, and weight gain can be easily attributed to a slowing metabolism or lack of exercise due to painful joints"
703_0,0,"another culprit of eating disorders that develop in early to mid-adulthood and follow men and women into older adulthood is the added external pressure to look younger because of social media platforms like instagram, facebook, and the plethora of dating apps on the market"
704_0,0," single adults or those becoming grandparents for the first time might dread the idea of a changing body, so as a means to take control, they might put their bodies through extreme dieting, which later develops into a full-blown eating disorder, a mental health disorder which left untreated will follow that person throughout life"
705_0,0,"as mentioned above, eating disorders are often triggered when people feel a lack of control over their lives"
706_0,0," and as most adults can attest, significant life changes in which a person feels a loss of control tend to happen during middle adulthood"
707_0,0," eating disorders are often used as a coping mechanism, so when a person loses a job, is forced to file bankruptcy, goes through a divorce, or loses a parent or other loved one, they might turn to the old behaviors and actions of their eating disorders to regain control over a situation that is completely out of their control"
708_0,0,"and as adults grow older, beyond middle adulthood, they often have to give up control over very basic aspects of their lives—they may have to give up driving, or move into an assisted living facility where they cannot make their own food choices"
709_0,0," these examples depict a loss of independence, essentially a loss of control over their own lives"
710_0,0," in an attempt to regain some of that control, some may turn to past (or current) eating disorder behaviors to cope"
711_0,0,some may argue that older adults are less likely to seek help and continue to battle their symptoms because they don’t want to burden family members or caregivers
712_0,0, others believe that older individuals have less motivation to heal themselves
713_0,0," as quoted in an article published in medical news today, some older individuals may not try to fight their eds because they have fewer motivations or goals for the future"
714_0,0, others might already see themselves in an “end-of-life” phase and they don’t want to put in the work or burden their families if they are nearing the end of their lives
715_0,0,"seeking treatment for this mental disorder that has such an immense impact on a person’s physical health could actually help older adults live longer, more fulfilled lives, no matter where they are in their life"
716_0,0," eating disorders—especially in older adults with weakened immune systems, bone structures, and other weakened bodily systems—can, and likely will, lead to further health complications"
717_0,0," obesity caused by bed can lead to heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and other related issues"
718_0,0," on the other hand, anorexia can bring about arrhythmia, bone loss (which can develop into osteoporosis), anemia, and even heart failure"
719_0,0,"the coping strategies, motivations, and potential side-effects outlined above are only examples of how an eating disorder might look in an older adult"
720_0,0," however, it’s important to remember that these disorders are different for everybody"
721_0,0," as loved ones, friends, coworkers, caregivers, or even strangers, you must never minimize the illness; and especially pertinent for those caring for older adults, it’s important that you don’t discount the possibility of an eating disorder because, as discussed above, disorders in older adults can be tricky to spot"
722_0,0,"here at the emily program, roughly 13 percent of our clients are ages 41-55"
723_0,0," however, we don’t have firm statistics on how many clients we serve over the age of 55"
724_0,0, that’s because the number of older adults seeking treatment past 55 drops dramatically
725_0,0, we don’t want that to be the case—we strive to serve all those afflicted by eating disorders
726_0,0," so if you think your loved one might be suffering, please take a look at the emily program’s guide for families for ideas on how to help your mother, sister, uncle, friend, neighbor, or anyone else get the treatment they deserve"

779_0,0, what kind of licensed professional would tell me to have a little ice cream at every meal? she just called pizza the perfect food because it hits a lot of food groups
780_0,0," um, does she know how many calories are in a slice? i have never been more ready for ashton kutcher to appear and tell me i was in the middle of a prank"
781_0,0,by this time i was surviving on a small baggie of popchips a day
782_0,0," in my mind, popchips were “good” for some inexplicable reason, and every other food was “bad"

789_0,0," but then we’d get home and i’d quietly cry myself to sleep, feeling like i was spiraling out of my own control"
790_0,0," every time i ate something other than my portioned-out popchips, it was like this boulder i had been rolling up a hill—a burden of weight loss and self-control—tumbled back to the bottom, and i had to start all over, restricting myself more and more as punishment"

804_0,0, they drove me an hour away to meet with this small team of medical professionals who would put me back together
805_0,0, i wondered why everyone was making such a fuss about a problem i didn’t have
806_0,0," i would do this after checking my stomach in the mirror and weighing myself, which occurred innumerable times a day"
807_0,0,"the dietitian, in a desperate attempt to get me to eat more calories, told me that it was ok to eat a small bite of ice cream at every meal"
808_0,0," i was also told that pizza, because it contained elements from most food groups, was the optimal meal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner"

819_0,0, i’d stop eating for a few days because i could feel a little stomach roll when i sat down
820_0,0, most of the time i did all of these things unnoticed by friends and family

831_0,0,"terms like osfed and ednos—though fuzzy and often criticized—definitely help me feel more welcome, like i belong to a community that understands me"

949_0,0,"that being said, it's very important for me to mention that i am not a licensed clinical psychologist, and that recovery as a whole can differ a lot between people, what works for one person might not always work for another, so if you read through some of the resources below and don't find one to be particularly helpful for you, feel free to move past it and go on to the next, you know yourself and what you need best"
950_0,0," additionally, if you're currently in a position where you feel as though you need medical or therapeutic intervention and can't commit to recovery on your own, please do seek out the support you need"
951_0,0," in the 'additional resources' section below, i've included a couple of links to low cost therapy options that might be helpful for some to utilize (they're only available in the u"
952_0,0,"s & canada though - sorry about that, all the other resources mentioned however should be available worldwide)"

1022_0,0,"this pervasive ignorance is symptomatic of an ed landscape that only caters to the privileged few who can pay for (often cost-prohibitive) treatment, with research generally reifying these ed archetypes of youth, whiteness, cisgender identity, ability, and middle/high-income status; eclipsing the gigantic population of marginalized folx with eds who don't fit these stereotypes and often fail to seek treatment because of accessibility/affordability issues, a lack of representation in the ed research canon/media, and a lack of cultural competency amongst healthcare professionals"
1023_0,0," vandemark founded t-ffed to provide accessible, gender-literate community-led healing spaces for trans and gender non-conforming folx, to amplify marginalized voices and experiences, and to develop a standard for trans cultural competency in the ed recovery field"

1028_0,0," however, i remember now the feeling of failure and disappointment that this diagnosis meant i wasn’t even successful at achieving the low weight status of anorexia"
1029_0,0, i’ve recently discovered from reading diaries i’ve kept throughout my life that body image issues and a guilty relationship with “naughty foods” have plagued me forever
1030_0,0,forward wind two years and my depression had sunk to a critical low
1031_0,0," another inpatient stay, seeing psychiatrists twice a week, every single medication combination, experimental trials of magnetic electrode therapy and electro-convulsive shock treatments saw me a monosyllabic shell of a person whose depression had now been reclassified as untreatable, worse to me than a terminal diagnosis"

1033_0,0,my parents brought me back from my adopted and once very loved home/life in australia which i’d loved for 15 years to take care of me in my childhood home
1034_0,0, i no longer cared where i was
1035_0,0," the fight against the depression and the hope of recovery was no longer a possibility and my existence was sleep, hours of quiz shows (i had no interest or ability to focus on anything with a plot) a daily walk and meals"
1036_0,0, everything was out of my control except those meals
1037_0,0," my illness had cost me everythingmy personality, my intellect, my passions, my home, my job, my friends"
1038_0,0,everything
1039_0,0,it was certainly not body image that led to that strict control
1040_0,0,i lived in baggy t-shirts and jogging bottoms and saw no one except my parents and doctors
1041_0,0," but after a lifetime of amazing achievements, the only thing i could achieve, as another day ended, was the knowledge that i couldn’t have eaten any less – the same boring thing and quantity and mealtimes every day"
1042_0,0," i’d disciplined myself to self-imposed mealtimes, resisted the hunger, and pitiful as those meals were, they were the only glimmers of brightness in my dark, dark days"
1043_0,0,my parents didn’t give up on me though
1044_0,0,"a new psychiatrist sent me for another ed assessment, and i was shocked (/delighted!) that i’d “achieved” anorexia!! i know"
1045_0,0,just the first signs of the illogicality of an ed
1046_0,0, but i was too beaten down by depression to resist going into hospital for it
1047_0,0," even that first day there, the silent, emotionless, numb tori turned into a screaming, hysterical devil as that last vestige of control was taken away and i was faced with the scariest thing i could imagine"
1048_0,0,a glass of milk
1049_0,0,"during that torturous five months in hospital i miraculously recovered from the depression (anxiety in the dining room made me forge friendships and chat with others to distract myself, desperation to get off the ward saw me going to ot classes and slowly rediscovering things i enjoyed doing)"
1050_0,0," however, i picked up every fear food from every other patient and learnt every trick in the book to eat the minimum possible, exercise the most and influence those dreaded scales, hide the hysterics, put the mask on of someone embracing recovery and deceive the professionals in every way to get discharged"
1051_0,0,"so i came out having rediscovered a will to live i’d thought i’d lost forever, but far further entrenched in the grips of anorexia"
1052_0,0, in the three-month gap between discharge and starting day care i lost so much weight i was unrecognisable and physically critical
1053_0,0, one evening i went to the bathroom and had a panic attack and started screaming as i looked in the mirror and saw the face looking back at me
1054_0,0,for the first time i was terrified
1055_0,0, that was my turning point
1056_0,0, i fully expected on my first day at day care for them to section me but they listened to how desperate i was for the psychological support and ability to really recover rather than disciplined refeeding in a hospital environment and they gave me a chance (on the caveat that i didn’t lose a gram more)
1057_0,0, since that day my recovery has progressed (frustratingly slowly but progress nonetheless) and the inspiration was the wonderful life of travel and adventure and enjoyment of food i’d been blessed with prior to my illness
1058_0,0,"i’ve worked tirelessly in day care, private therapy and on my own to get as “recovered” as i can possibly be"
1059_0,0, i wasn’t content with surviving with an ed
1060_0,0," to me the mental torture and confines are the worst part, so a healthy body without a quality of life was not enough"
1061_0,0," i don’t want to have the strains of the illness on the relationships with my friends and family, i don’t want to be on a “menu plan” forever, i don’t want to be the person who looks on at envy at social occasions as other people relax and enjoy their food, drool at food street markets in foreign climes and then find a private spot to eat my packed lunch! my passion is travelling and very early on in my recovery i started to travel again"
1062_0,0," in the last two years i’ve been to france numerous times, germany, bulgaria, spain twice, poland, australia for five weeks and backpacking solo for four weeks around cuba"
1063_0,0," these trips have been hard work food-wise but i book them and worry about the practicalities later, and each trip i become more and more relaxed around food"
1064_0,0," in all of the events/trips i’ve done, despite occasional wobbles (par for the course i’d say), i’ve found the enjoyment and pride i got out of them far outweighed any fleeting moments of fear/discomfort, and really the only real thing to fear is fear itself"
1065_0,0,i’m inspired by podcasts/recovery blogs of people who have really recovered
1066_0,0," that’s not to say that there’s never anxiety around food but that’s pretty common in a lot of people and unfortunately a result of the society we live in, but i set myself challenges every day"
1067_0,0, once one fear food/situation is conquered i just raise the ante! but i like everyone had to start with baby steps
1068_0,0," my goal is intuitive eating and finding my healthy body point, whatever size that might be"
1069_0,0," i’m not there yet but that light at the end of the tunnel i couldn’t see for so long, when i was really wondering why i was working so hard and dealing with the enormous complexity of thoughts/fears/challenges every single waking moment and not feeling any progress, is shining bright"
1070_0,0,"i read a chinese parable that rang so true to meafter planting and daily tending, nourishing and watering chinese bamboo there’s no evidence of life for the first four years"
1071_0,0," the gardener’s patience is tested, and they wonder if their efforts will ever be rewarded"
1072_0,0,"but in the fifth year it sprouts through the soil and grows 80 feet in six weeks! not only that, but due to the first four years of attention it’s developed such a strong root system it’s fortified against whatever nature throws at it"
1073_0,0,that is my recovery
1074_0,0," progress, though slow, has been enormous"
1075_0,0," i used to obsess over a single calorie, used to deceive people who cared about me in defence of my ed, feel the guilt of eating, the guilt of restriction, the guilt of bingeing"
1076_0,0, guilt about everything
1077_0,0, i felt powerless to its inordinate strength over me and the way it had permeated and negatively affected every single aspect of my life
1078_0,0, but through my hard work and the support of my family (who are collateral victims to this insidious disease too) i’m now back in control
1079_0,0,the irony
1080_0,0,"that control i was so proud of, and protective of, wasn’t mine but the ed’s; that guilt and fear and behaviour wasn’t me but the ed"
1081_0,0,"i know the traits that led me to an ed – perseverance, goal-driven, organisation, attention to detail and intelligence (anyone with an ed will know the permutations and calculations that have to be constantly reconfigured and mental gymnastics that come with the disease/recovery) – can be strengths rather than weaknesses if channelled in a healthy direction"
1082_0,0," i love myself more than i ever did, exactly who i am"
1083_0,0, i’m proud of myself; i have more compassion for others
1084_0,0," i adopted a daily practice of journaling, gratitude, smile and achievement lists from my first day in recovery and not one day have those lists been empty despite the rollercoaster! experiencing such an evil illness can make you appreciate the simplest things and consider the smallest steps to recovery an achievement"
1085_0,0,"so what’s my next big challenge? well, i was going to jump out of a plane"
1086_0,0," everyone i spoke to said how brave that would make me, but i realised i wasn’t at all nervous about that and joked that the real challenge would be taking me unexpectedly to pret a manger to eat a sandwich! so my new fundraising event for beat is “dining in the dark”a mystery three-course dinner served without any hint of what is on the plates and in the pitch dark, plus on communal tables with other diners i don’t know"
1087_0,0,"i’m not ashamed of suffering from an illness – i refuse to be identified by it, i educate people i meet about the complex nature of eating disorders and that weight has no bearing on the mental (real) side of the illness, in addition to busting other misconceptions"
1088_0,0," the journey has been/is still hard but it’s so worth it and i’m not done with it yet! treatment in this country is inadequate and recovery stories, practical steppingstones and plans for meaningful recovery need to be sought out, but they are there, and everyone can achieve real recovery – quality of life, goals unimpeded by the cloud of fear"
1089_0,0, an ed does not have to be a death sentence or a lifetime of relapses interspersed with living dictated to by the ed in that mental and physical prison
1090_0,0, we all have the power within us – our paths to recovery may look different but there is one out there for all of us
1091_0,0,i want more for my life than what anorexia has to
1092_0,0,"beat would like to keep you informed about our work, fundraising activities, and campaigns"
1093_0,0,there’s no question that letting go of an eating disorder is one of the hardest things a person can do
1094_0,0, it’s also important to note that each individual will follow their own unique path to recovery
1095_0,0,"while there is no magic wand to wave away all the stress, challenges and difficult moments, i’ll try to provide the next best thingsome secrets shared by individuals who have been in your shoes and ended up being able to kick ed to the curb"

1100_0,0," feed your soulif your body and brain are being deprived, you are less likely to reap the benefits of everything from therapy to mindfulness"
1101_0,0," regardless of body shape or size, malnourishment increases the risk of medical complications, co-morbid psychiatric symptoms and distorted thinking"
1102_0,0, consider ways to nourish yourself beyond just the physical piece
1103_0,0, look at ways to feed your soul
1104_0,0," we nourish our bodies with food, and our minds and hearts with knowledge and love"
1105_0,0, it takes a villageone person can’t give you the keys to recovery
1106_0,0," rather, you likely require a team – one that holds you accountable and provides the knowledge and skill set you need for recovery"
1107_0,0, a dietitian specialized in eating disorders can help you navigate your food rules and ultimately normalize your eating
1108_0,0, a medical doctor (md) or nurse practitioner (np) can monitor you for medical complications and provide a much needed reality check regarding the seriousness of your illness
1109_0,0, finding a therapist that you really connect with will give you an ally to help better understand yourself and your eating disorder
1110_0,0," while it isn’t unheard of for people to recover on their own, it is immeasurably easier with a strong team of professionals by your side"
1111_0,0,"“if you have friends who want to do things with you, it helps to keep you out of your head and also forces you to go to meals"
1112_0,0, eventually the fun of having friends will outweigh the fear of eating
1113_0,0, they also provide a good model for more normalized eating patterns
1114_0,0, but mainly i think friends give you something to live for because you make great memories and truly feel a sense of support
1115_0,0, also fomo is real
1116_0,0, don’t forget the best policymany recovered individuals will stress that honesty is key to success
1117_0,0," because the eating disorder thrives in secrecy, being honest is a way to defy ed and stake a claim on recovery"
1118_0,0," in addition, being open with your family and friends can be a great motivator to keep going"
1119_0,0, be wicked “skilly”an eating disorder is an incredibly effective coping mechanism…until it isn’t
1120_0,0," and while this is an oversimplification of a very complex disease that can involve genetics, temperament, trauma and a host of other contributors, it is undeniable that the use of eating disorder behaviors meets a very immediate need to dull or distract from unpleasant feelings or things"
1121_0,0,you cannot take away a coping mechanism (whether it is maladaptive or not) without replacing it with something else
1122_0,0, how about adding healthy coping strategies to your toolkit? this is where all those hours of dbt are going to come in handy
1123_0,0,"the key to internalizing skills is to practice them often, at all times of day"
1124_0,0," repetition and time will help the brain form new neural pathways, and slowly but surely these habits will replace the old, unhealthful ones"
1125_0,0," find yourselfeating disorders are often ego-syntonic, or in other words, consistent with one’s sense of self"
1126_0,0," when you make the decision to break free of ed, it can feel like giving up a part of your identity, maybe one that you have held on to for a long time"
1127_0,0," in the same way you must add new ways to self-regulate when you begin to abstain from your eating disorder behaviors, rediscovering your sense of self is key to maintaining your recovery"
1128_0,0," a journal can be a great way to do this, especially if you use writing prompts"
1129_0,0, make lists of the things that define you outside of your eating disorder
1130_0,0," explore your relationship to others in your life, as a child, parent, spouse or friend"
1131_0,0," what are you passionate about? do you prefer horror movies or comedies? what subjects do you like best in school, or what is your favorite thing about your job? what makes you feel connected? what are your pet peeves? as the eating disorder identity fades away, making sure that you are there to take its place is the best way to ensure it never comes back"

1154_0,0,that was my first binge
1155_0,0, little did i know how much worse it would get

1157_0,0,"i had dieted on and off most of my life, but any time i tried a diet that told me what i was and wasn’t allowed to eat (atkins was the first of many), i never managed to last longer than a day or two before i’d “blow it” and give up"
1158_0,0,"prior to the day of my first binge, i had actually lost a lot of weight on my own, simply by counting calories, but i hired a trainer because, while i reached my goal weight on my own, i still hated my body and wasn’t happy"
1159_0,0,"so, i did the only thing i knew to do at the time—pay someone else to tell me what to eat so i could have a perfect body and finally be happy"
1160_0,0,i white knuckled my way through four whole days before i found myself at the grocery store feeling much like i’d imagine a junkie feels as their high begins to wear off
1161_0,0, i needed a fix and was jonesing bad
1162_0,0,"the next day, i barely ate anything and ran for about two hours to punish myself for being such a pig the day prior"
1163_0,0,"within a few months, i was sitting in a therapist’s office hearing him call me bulimic while i bawled hysterically and begged him to tell me how to stop feeling so completely out of control with food"
1164_0,0,"the harder i tried to control my intake, the more out of control i became"
1165_0,0,"the more out of control i felt, the worse i felt about myself and treated my body"
1166_0,0,"depression, panic attacks, bingeing, and restricting/over exercising (those were my compensatory behaviors) took over my world"
1167_0,0,"i spent a lot of time with my therapist, and he never really gave me answer for what was wrong with me (beyond the eating disorder) or how to fix it"
1168_0,0,it just kept getting worse
1169_0,0,my body would shake and i’d be so desperate to get into whatever food i had as fast as humanly possible that i’d usually end up eating an entire large bag of candy on the drive home before continuing to eat until i was sick once i got home
1170_0,0,after awhile i started noticing that it literally felt like a hole in the center of my being that i was frantically trying to fill—unsuccessfully
1171_0,0," no matter how much i stuffed in there, it just never ever felt full"
1172_0,0,what started with one small bag of candy turned into a monster inside me that i could not control
1173_0,0, it morphed from a bag of candy to eating myself sick and ultimately feeling like i was killing myself with food
1174_0,0," at my worst, there were nights when i had eaten so much i was legitimately scared i was going to have a heart attack in my sleep and wondered if i should go to er"
1175_0,0,so i started reading everything i could get my hands on
1176_0,0," i was desperate—desperate to not eat myself to death, but also desperate to find a way to stop so i could just have that perfect body and finally be happy"
1177_0,0,"but as i read, i came to realize that my bingeing wasn’t about the food"
1178_0,0," the over exercising and starving myself to compensate for the bingeing, none of it was about the food or exercise"
1179_0,0,"and my desperate need to have a perfect body, in order to be happy, wasn’t even about my body"
1180_0,0,it all had everything to do with how i felt about myself and my worth as a person
1181_0,0,i hated myself and felt worthless
1182_0,0,i didn’t think i was good enough for anything
1183_0,0,"and in that one moment of awakening, everything that was wrong in my life made complete sense"
1184_0,0,i finally knew why i was angry all the time—i was in pain
1185_0,0,"the starving, restricting, bingeing, and over exercising made sense—i was punishing myself"
1186_0,0,"the obsessive ways i dove into everything, including food and exercise, were attempts to keep myself numb and not address the pain"
1187_0,0,"i knew that if i ever had any hope of changing anything, i had to stop chasing the perfect body and start learning to love and value myself, which meant figuring out where the self-loathing and feelings of inadequacy were coming from"
1188_0,0,"the first thing i had to do in my process of healing, recovery, and growth was to start learning to be forgiving of myself and treat myself with compassion"
1189_0,0," i had been living with excruciating emotional pain my entire life that i never allowed myself to even acknowledge, never mind deal with"
1190_0,0,my constant anger didn’t make me a b*tch or a horrible person; it was a symptom of someone who was hurting deeply
1191_0,0,the initial weight problem that morphed into dieting/disordered eating and ultimately bulimia didn’t make me disgusting or weak; it was a symptom of someone who hated herself so badly she was punishing herself every day
1192_0,0,those realizations allowed me to start extending myself compassion for those things in me that i wasn’t proud of
1193_0,0, they allowed me the space to start healing
1194_0,0, because you cannot change while you believe you deserve to be punished
1195_0,0,i gave myself permission to eat whatever i wanted
1196_0,0,"i even gave myself permission to binge, and the weirdest thing happened—i began to do it less and less"
1197_0,0, now i cannot remember the last time i binged
1198_0,0, it’s been years
1199_0,0,"it sounds crazy, like the opposite of what we should do"
1200_0,0,"but when i realized the purpose it was serving and stopped judging myself for it so i could work on actually healing the need it was filling, it all changed"
1201_0,0,"you see, as long as we’re judging and hating ourselves, we’ll always feel like we’re bad and deserve to be punished"
1202_0,0," and as long as we believe we’re bad and deserve to be punished, we’ll never stop punishing ourselves"
1203_0,0,"it came down to five basic mindset switches for mepermission, acceptance, compassion, kindness, and curiosity"
1204_0,0,permissionit’s okay because i’m doing the best i can with what i know right now
1205_0,0," when i learn how to better handle these feelings, i’ll make more loving choices for myself"
1206_0,0,"acceptanceit sucks pretty bad, but it’s my journey"
1207_0,0," for whatever reason, whatever i’m supposed to learn from this, this is the journey i’m supposed to be on"
1208_0,0,compassionhow would i speak to a friend or client going through this? that’s how i started trying to speak to myself
1209_0,0,"kindnessthe worse i felt, the kinder i was to myself"
1210_0,0,curiosityi couldn’t just blindly give myself permission to binge forever without actively getting curious about why i was doing it
1211_0,0," so, every time it would happen, i’d spend a lot of time asking myself why"
1212_0,0,alongside making those changes i also worked on learning to love and value myself and change the stories i had been telling myself about who i was and what i was worth my whole life
1213_0,0,"so, dieting may have made me bulimic, but my obsession with finding happiness and self-acceptance by building a perfect body led me down a path of learning to love myself and create happiness from within"
1214_0,0,i am enough
1215_0,0,and so are you
1216_0,0," so give yourself permission, acceptance, compassion, and kindness, and get curious about why you do the things you do"

277_1,1, here is a perfect one to attain the thigh gap (note that all diets and exercises are drawn from internet sources)
278_1,1, objectives of pro ana support sitesthe pro ana lifestyle is a lonely one
279_1,1," with the growing resistance towards the proana way of life, rexies often get lonely and need to connect with other rexies who are on the same journey"
280_1,1,"if you search well enough, you will find support sites as well as whatsapp groups that offer support and advice"
281_1,1,"facets of the pro ana lifestylemethodspro ana forums share weight loss tips, motivational messages and images and communal dieting opportunities"
282_1,1,devotionpro anorexia enthusiasts have found solace in the “goddess of emaciation” 
283_1,1, she is the true image of skinny=beautiful and she offers constant encouragement to her subjects
284_1,1,some site owners even write letters from ana which serve as encouragement for the members to keep up the lifestyle
285_1,1,"follow pro ana rules to the letterpro ana sites encourage rule following with sayings such as, “what nourishes me destroys me”"
286_1,1,"all anas must follow the commandments and directions, failure to which they will face thorough punishment"
287_1,1,anas must maintain confidentiality at all times
288_1,1,pro ana sites are largely private groups and admission to these sites requires approval by the site’s administrators
289_1,1," new members are therefore forced to post their current and ideal weight, age and sex on the site before they can be approved to join the community"
290_1,1," members must post photographs of themselves, accompanied by their body statistics as well as keep members updated of their weight loss progresspro ana symbols the dragonfly is seen to be the symbol for pro ana"
291_1,1," anas, as pro ana enthusiasts refer to themselves, identify with this insect because of its long, thin body, beautiful/ colorful body color and its light, translucent wings"
292_1,1,"pro-anna individuals see these insects as the epitome of beauty and elegance, a state in which they hope to achieve themselves"
293_1,1,a silver dragonfly charm features in red bracelets to separate them from regular bracelets and to further help anas identify each other on the streets
294_1,1," further, the addition of the dragonfly charm indicates a sense of pride in the practice"
295_1,1,pro-ana braceletsred bracelets with a dragonfly charm
296_1,1, these bracelets come in many different designs and can even be made at home as perpetuated by diy sites
297_1,1, sites that carry the merchandise sell them for between $10 to $35
298_1,1,the tag “red bracelet project” now features on most pro ana sites encouraging their followers to wear the bracelet as a secret message to each other so they can identify each other on the streets while remaining unobtrusive enough to be ignored by those outside the religion
299_1,1,such tricks are psychological games intended to make the lifestyle appear more interesting and fun for its followers at an age when the fad is receiving increasing criticism
300_1,1,"further, the colorful and beautiful bracelets serve as a constant reminder to anas that they should keep up the practices while serving as a badge of honor to those who are “succeeding”"
301_1,1,people who defend the pro ana bracelets claim that they provide a way for people who are suffering from anorexia to identify each other and those who will not judge them as they work through their problems
302_1,1,"they, therefore, use this sense of community narrative to justify the wearing of pro ana bracelets but there are more people wearing the bracelets who are current subscribers of the religion than those who are recovering from it"
303_1,1,"in essence, they take advantage of the isolation felt by those suffering from anorexia, which is a not so common mental illness, by selling them the “community narrative” which only draws them back to the lifestyle they are struggling to leave all for the sake of a few bucks"
304_1,1,"pro ana shirts and other merchandisefor those who dislike wearing bracelets, a red t-shirt on mondays is advised"
305_1,1, these serve the same role played by the bracelets and help pro ana individuals recognize each other on the street
306_1,1,"but as the fad increasingly gains momentum, online shopping malls are now openly selling pro ana branded merchandise such as shirts, mugs, bags and more"
307_1,1, pro ana songsthis was perhaps the most shocking discovery of my research into this underground fad
308_1,1,"a musician called king adora has a song titled big isn’t beautiful with lyrics such as “i want to feel my bones on your bones,” “skinny is sexy, sweet anorexia, skinny is sexy, big isn’t beautiful” and other similarly catchy lyrics"
309_1,1,"other artists in this genre include catatonia, jill sobule, outcast youth, anorexic beauty, lemon and so much more"
310_1,1,the songs are disturbing to say the least and they further feed into the fears of most youths who seek love and acceptance
311_1,1,"pro ana booksas stated above, skinny bitch is a best-selling book that advocates the pro ana lifestyle which is rampant in the modeling industry"
312_1,1, it is one of many books but all would be well if the books only sold dietary plans because then most of those exposed to them would be those who actively seek them out
313_1,1,"however, the sad reality is that the sites have resulted in an upsurge in the rate of romance novels that simply romanticize this notion"
314_1,1,"a cursory search of wattpad, a popular online novels site, indicates that the hashtags pro ana tips, anorexia and pro mia (standing for those who advocate for bulimia) are common and rampantly used"
315_1,1,the psychological effect of this is that readers who are simply seeking fictional tales will be exposed to a romanticized version of the diseases (anorexia and bulimia) leading to their eventual desensitization of the seriousness of the illnesses
316_1,1,"this situation creates alarm because these readers could end up joining the religion without a proper understanding of its ramification, especially for the vulnerable youth who may already be facing body image issues"
317_1,1,facts about anorexiaanorexia nervosa is a life-threatening psychological disease which is characterized by an eating disorder resulting in extremely low body weight relative to the body mass index (bmi) of those suffering from it
318_1,1," types of anorexiathere are two major types of this disease and they are:restrictive anorexia where the individuals literally starve themselves by consuming lower than the required quantities of food required to maintain a healthy body weightpurge anorexia whereby the individuals suffering from the disease purge themselves by vomiting, using laxatives or excessively exercising"
319_1,1, this behavior arises from an intense sense of guilt from eating too much food or eating the wrong type of food
320_1,1,isolation behavior whereby the individual withdraws from his/ her close family and friends and prefers to be alone
321_1,1,lanugo which is fine hair growing all over the body including the facecauses of anorexiaanorexia has been attributed to a variety of environmental and biological factors
322_1,1,the environmental factors are:the media which perpetuates the thinner is better narrative whereby the beautiful and happy individuals are portrayed as thin people
323_1,1," anorexia is therefore a byproduct of this culturesome professions such as modeling, acting, and dancing also cause this disease because they promote the thinness culture for success in such field;peer pressure to be thin can result in anorexia especially among the youth who value acceptance in society and associate it to their personal image or view of success"
324_1,1,traumatic history or events such as sexual abuse can also cause anorexia the same way they can cause other self-destructive behaviorbiological causes of anorexia include:irregular hormone functionsgenetics although scientist are yet to establish the actual link between genetics and anorexia
325_1,1,"treatment of anorexiathe treatment of an individual suffering from anorexia includes a combination of medical, nutritional and therapeutic factors"
326_1,1,"medical aid seeks to treat the symptoms which include amenorrhea and malnutrition, nutritional aid helps the patient come up with a new and healthier meal plan to restore the excess lost body weight"
327_1,1,patients are also trained on the importance of better eating patterns
328_1,1," finally, a therapist counsels the patient to help them understand the actual issues the patient is suffering from so as to address them and prevent the patient from relapsing into anorexic behavior"
329_1,1," final words:ultimately, the pro ana tips and tricks is all about perception"
330_1,1, it is important to remember that your health should be the number one priority
331_1,1,"truth be told, there are some crazy tips associated with pro ana or thinspiration lifestyles so keep a sober head on your shoulders and even as you endeavor to lose weight, you don’t practice the extremist practices out there"
332_1,1,it is also worth mentioning that some despicable characters out there who pretend to be in the pro ana lifestyle but they are pedophiles and phishing experts
333_1,1,be careful who you engage in so the only thing you lose is those stubborn calories and nothing else
334_1,1,"shari thanks in favor of sharing such a pleasant opinion, paragraph is pleasant"

401_1,1,anon you are the reason sites that promote support such as mpa get shamed
402_1,1, we’re not a cult

405_1,1,"crazy figurelive healthy, look healthyhometipsskinhealthoctober 28, 2019 by natalia leave a commentabc diet plan pros & cons with diet chart [including faq’s]the endless quest for the ideal weight and body shape has been a goal which has been pursued universally for centuries"
406_1,1, to aid people in that quest many different exercises and dietary plans have surfaced over the years
407_1,1, some of them have garnered more success than the others
408_1,1, today we are going to discuss one such successful diet plan that has been making waves all over the world due to the stunning results it has produced and more importantly because of its controversial methodology
409_1,1, it is famously known as the abc diet or ana boot camp diet in full
410_1,1,the radical diet plan is based on manipulating your metabolic system to speed itself up without adversely affecting your physical health or kicking your system into survival mode
411_1,1,the main focus of the diet is on tricking the body’s metabolism into top gear without going into starvation mode
412_1,1," once the metabolism rate increases, body fats (lipids) are burnt at a faster rate than normal which aids significantly in weight loss and shaping up your body towards your desired goal"
413_1,1, the challenge however lies in the execution of the entire dietary plan which is easier said than done
414_1,1, a major roadblock that immediately arises upon consumption of reduced amount of food is the body automatically going into survival mode
415_1,1, survival mode is simply when fat reserves inside the body are frantically built up due to the anticipation that a future shortage/crisis of food supply may arise
416_1,1, this reaction by the body will dramatically reduce any chances of weight loss altogether
417_1,1, in fact it may further aggravate the existing situation by increasing the existing body weight
418_1,1, that is precisely why it so often observed that overweight people gain weight despite low intake of food because they regularly skip breakfast or don’t eat breakfast properly as is recommended

423_1,1,particular diet specifically caters to replenishing those nutrients accordingly

945_1,1,contents1 what is bulimia?2 bingeing and purgingpro mia tips and tricks3 pro mia diet tips and tricks3
946_1,1,1 food recommended to eat for bulimic diet:3
947_1,1,"bulimia is the lifestyle where a person eats, either very little or normally but after eating they force themselves to throw up"
948_1,1," in other words, they sometimes binge on their favorite food and then clean up their system by purging"
949_1,1," the latter is mostly done by stimulating the gag reflex, either by sticking some foreign object, if not, then their own finger down their throat"
950_1,1," but in order to maintain this condition, one needs to remain motivated and here are a few pro mia tips that will help you stay motivated"
951_1,1,think about how the food will look like after you have chewed it up
952_1,1, and then you’ll be glad to vomit it out of your system
953_1,1,think about your own body
954_1,1, how great you will look like after it ends
955_1,1,think about whom you would look like after this ends
956_1,1,"think about that whenever you purge, how close you have reached your goal"
957_1,1,drink salt water after bingeing
958_1,1, this will retain all the water and make purging easy afterward
959_1,1,"take laxatives in the ratio of 2, 4, 6, 8 so that your body doesn’t get used to it, as you need to take higher and higher doses with each passing day"
960_1,1," like 2 the first day, followed by 4 the second, 6 on the third day and 8 on the forth"
961_1,1, then you need to fast for one day i
962_1,1,", don’t use any laxatives and then start the cycle again"
963_1,1," by this tip, you are mainly tricking your body"
964_1,1,mineral oil is a less harmful yet effective laxative
965_1,1, and so you can buy it easily from any grocery stores
966_1,1,drink lots of water while eating
967_1,1, this will not only make the food get up easily but will also enhance its taste
968_1,1," also, it will make you feel full early, so you have to puke out less"
969_1,1,just gulp down a can of soda before you purge
970_1,1, the bubbles will again help the food to come up
971_1,1," you can also drink it while eating, as it will fill you up faster, and with that icky feeling in stomach, you can easily throw up"
972_1,1,push on your stomach
973_1,1,use your stomach muscles to push the food up
974_1,1,"another way to purge is by stimulating the gag reflex, by using one or more than one finger"
975_1,1, just wiggle them a little to “tickle
976_1,1,you can also use soak your fingers in warm water and then suck it up
977_1,1,you can also try to cough or mimic gentle choking while you are gagging
978_1,1, this also helps to help food come up through your throat
979_1,1,binge after you exercise
980_1,1, this boosts your metabolism and helps you burn up the stuff that you can’t purge
981_1,1,if possible try to puke in your bedroom using a bag or something because of a shiny layer on top of the water after you puke
982_1,1,after you purge don’t brush your teeth! this results in the decay of tooth enamel due to the acid
983_1,1, so just rinse your mouth with either water or mouthwash
984_1,1,always opt for puking in the shower
985_1,1, this is the easiest way than anything else because you not only get to relax in the hot water until you are ready to purge again
986_1,1, but it also hides the noise when you throw up in a shower
987_1,1," and if you have decided to go this way, then make sure that after puking there is no vomit left and also make sure that you have not eaten chunky foods"
988_1,1,if your eyes get red after throwing up (in case you just threw up in public or have friends around) then come back and tell them that it is due to your contacts
989_1,1," like you were trying to take them out, but now replacing them is driving you crazy and so you have red eyes"
990_1,1,drink a large glass of water and follow it up with about 100 sit-ups
991_1,1, then repeat the same process of gulping water and doing push-ups
992_1,1, do it until your stomach is full with water
993_1,1," make sure you do it fast, as this will make the food come up fast and with less acid"
994_1,1,what is more degrading while puking in a toilet is being splashed by the potty water or your own vomit
995_1,1," and so if you are used to forceful purging, then you can lessen this splashing thig by putting toilet paper on the water surface"
996_1,1,"look at some repulsing pictures of the food that you don’t like, or some nasty food, or of people vomiting, this will not only make you sick but also help you to purge"
997_1,1,say that you are on your periods and so don’t feel like eating
998_1,1, and so no matter what
999_1,1, you can always skip your meal
1000_1,1,"out of all the above tips and tricks, whatever you choose, just stay away from ipecac syrup"
1001_1,1, it is an extremely dangerous syrup that can even be poisonous
1002_1,1, it will not only help you throw up but can also damage your heart permanently
1003_1,1,another important tip for bulimia is having the correct diet

1011_1,1, the pro mia tips shared by such groups make the process of becoming bulimic easier and more acceptable than the treatment and recovery process for it
1012_1,1,"bulimia or bulimic condition seems to be a lifestyle for some, but it is potentially harmful to everyone, especially when they cannot put a stop to this condition"
1013_1,1, the fate of seriously ill bulimics is death

1667_1,1,it is my thinking that there is something out there that can only be described as borderline anorexia
1668_1,1,this as having the mental state of an anoretic (i
1669_1,1,"control to restrict your calories, etc"
1670_1,1,) but not looking severely underweight
1671_1,1,i believe that there is also something that can be called disordered eating
1672_1,1,"maintain a normal, if low, weight"

1736_1,1," type in pro ana blog, and half the results is shaming us for not eating, for having these blogs"
1737_1,1," plus, most of the pro ana blogs left are from, like, 2014"
1738_1,1," i was tired of going through half-finished, out-of-date blogs, so i made my own"
1739_1,1,"i support recovery, but am not in it myself"
1740_1,1,my name is caty

1744_1,1," currently, i am 109 (march 30 2019)"
1745_1,1,pro ana is not a religion here- just a lifestyle
1746_1,1," i’m not trying to teach you to have an eating disorder, this is merely a refuge"
1747_1,1," it’s that little voice inside our head that we can’t seem to shake, but at least we don’t have to do it alone"
1748_1,1,"so welcome, love you lots"
1749_1,1," remember, calories are the enemy"
1750_1,1," you have control, you barely eat, and nothing tastes as good as skinny feels"
1751_1,1, saying no to food is saying yes to skinny
1752_1,1," but also, we are here to be skinny, not dead or hospitalized"
1753_1,1, and no one must ever find out
1754_1,1,"hey everyone! i know it’s been a couple days, i’ve just been crazy busy! i thought i would do a post based on something that came up in a group chat today"
1755_1,1,"i think it’s easy to get mixed up in perception vs reality, especially in our community, because it is virtually all over the internet, not face to face"
1756_1,1," we see each other through a screen, and sometimes all we see is words spoken"
1757_1,1, especially on blogs and tumblrs
1758_1,1," it’s a little more real when it comes to kik, but even then, not much"
1759_1,1,here’s where my idea to write this came from
1760_1,1," i sent my food log to a group chat, which read 486 consumed, 428 burned, net 59"
1761_1,1," the responses ranged from “wow caty, you are so in control!” to “omg perfect” and to “i wish i could do that, you make it look so easy” and so on and so forth"
1762_1,1, i didn’t think i had done anything remarkable
1763_1,1, so i looked at it again
1764_1,1, i realized that it did look good
1765_1,1, on paper
1766_1,1," but i didn’t mention how 300 of those calories came from me eating mini muffins, crying about it in my room, and then working out out of self hate to burn it off"
1767_1,1,we are all struggling
1768_1,1," just because it looks pretty on paper, doesn’t mean it’s pretty in real life"
1769_1,1," i get responses from my blog asking me to coach, people telling me i’m perfect, i’m in control, and so on and so forth"
1770_1,1, i am here to tell you i am not perfect
1771_1,1," i struggle, i feel like i’ve failed myself, i binge, i cry, i want to die sometimes"
1772_1,1, just because i run a blog does not magically make me a “better ana”
1773_1,1,which brings me into my next point
1774_1,1, everyone’s struggle is different
1775_1,1," there is no perfect weigh, no perfect amount of calories, no perfect amount of exercise"
1776_1,1, you get the point
1777_1,1," 800 calories is a good day for some, and 800 calories is considered a binge to others"
1778_1,1, it is all about your personal journey
1779_1,1, don’t compare your struggle
1780_1,1, everyone is valid
1781_1,1," 120 pounds can be an extremely underweight weight on some heights, while 120 can also be perfectly attainable on other heights, and considered high on other heights"
1782_1,1," with that being said, please never let your bmi fall below 15"
1783_1,1, that’s when organs start to fail
1784_1,1, that’s when you start to die
1785_1,1," we want to be skinny, not dead"
1786_1,1,"alternatively, i know a lot of us feel alone sometimes"
1787_1,1, i hope that my posts have given you some kind of solace that you are not alone
1788_1,1, here’s a little more reassurance that you aren’t the only one struggling
1789_1,1," i am in multiple group chats on kik, each with around 20"
1790_1,1, all different people
1791_1,1," i had a tumblr with 2k (terminated), "
1792_1,1,"8k (terminated), and my current has "
1793_1,1, mostly different people
1794_1,1, all struggling
1795_1,1, this blog averages 400 views a day
1796_1,1, not all are the same
1797_1,1, all struggling
1798_1,1, you are not alone
1799_1,1," if you feel comfortable, post in the comments how you struggle so others can see they are not alone"
1800_1,1,"i know we compare ourselves to thinspo, but we should never compare our struggles"
1801_1,1, you are always valid
1802_1,1, no matter what
1803_1,1,"you can always contact me, kik me (catyspacen) and we can chat or i can add you to a group chat, or contact my tumblr (skinnygirlcornerrr)"
1804_1,1," i’ll always be here for you, no matter what"
1805_1,1, i’ll always be a friend
1806_1,1, i love and adore each and every one of you
1807_1,1, you give me so much purpose and i will always give back to you
1808_1,1,"stay safe, stay strong, stay skinny"
1809_1,1,"hey everyone! i know it’s been a couple of days since i last uploaded, i was super super busy! i’m back now with a lengthy post that i hope you’ll find interesting"
1810_1,1," if you remember when i asked if i should do something relating to poshmark, i got a lot of positive responses, so this will include that! quick disclaimer, i’ll be adding invite codes for some of these resources, but i am not paid and in no way affiliated with the companies"
1811_1,1, i’ll be super transparent to why i’m giving you them
1812_1,1,poshmark is by far my favorite app for reselling
1813_1,1,"poshmark is a buying and selling app and website! you can find new and preloved items at a fraction of the cost! it’s a great way to save money and save the earth! if you didn’t know, the amount of water it takes to make one pair of jeans could provide water for someone for 900 days"
1814_1,1, that’s two and a half years
1815_1,1,"first, set up an account! be careful with what you set your username as, though, because you can’t change it"
1816_1,1," when you sign up, you’ll see a box for an invite code"
1817_1,1," this is the only time you can input one, so do it! i wish i had! what does it do? it automatically gives you $5 to use towards a purchase! the person that referred you will only receive $5 towards their account if you buy something"
1818_1,1, i’d love it if you used minesecondstopposh
1819_1,1,take clear photos on a plain backdrop with natural light! i do mine on a white wall with a canon rebel t6 (but this isn’t necessary
1820_1,1," i have one because i love photography, so it’s just a plus i can use it for poshmark"
1821_1,1,"in your title, first list brand, then style if you can find it, then what the item is, then color"
1822_1,1, (exbrandy melville laila thermal black)
1823_1,1, this is seo (search engine optimization)
1824_1,1,write an accurate description
1825_1,1," include what the material is like, if it’s true to size, when you are likely to ship, if prices are negotiable, etc"
1826_1,1,always label brand correctly
1827_1,1," you have no idea how many people mistag brands for exposure, and it can get you banned"
1828_1,1, don’t do it
1829_1,1,look up comps (what a similar item from the same brand sold for) and use that to get an approximate of what you should list it for
1830_1,1, always price $5 higher than what you want to get for an item to leave room for offers
1831_1,1,follow! i cannot stress this enough
1832_1,1, it’s easy to get caught up in the instagram norm (more followers than following) but it doesn’t matter on poshmark
1833_1,1,share share share!!! self share and community share! the share button is the little icon with arrows on the bottom of a listing
1834_1,1," sharing is great for not only you, but also the community! it’s a great way to build friendships"
1835_1,1,packaging- poshmark soley ships through usps priority mail
1836_1,1," if you go to the usps website, you can order free priority mail shipping supplies, including tape! i also recommend picking up tissue paper (after christmas is such a good time!) to wrap your sold items in, and add a little thank you note! it’s a sweet personal touch that’s really meaningful"
1837_1,1,that’s the basics! i’ll go into some more tips in a minute
1838_1,1,that was just to get you started- here are some of my favorite tips
1839_1,1,30 minute method
1840_1,1, this is a theory that a posher came up with to hit all of the categories in the poshmark algorithm to optimize sales
1841_1,1," i use it and it definitely works, and i can usually complete it in around 15 minutes"
1842_1,1,"be consistent! try to share, list, etc at the same time or rate"
1843_1,1," for example, i always to the 30mm in order, i always list 5 a day, and i always share my whole closet at night"
1844_1,1,share your items to parties! it really helps with exposure
1845_1,1,do not lowball
1846_1,1," poshmark already takes 20%, and it’s definitely a good idea to make offers since sellers usually accept, but do it graciously"
1847_1,1," for example, if an item is listed for $25, the seller only gets $20 of that"
1848_1,1, i wouldn’t offer anything less than around $20
1849_1,1," at $20, the seller gets $16"
1850_1,1,use offers to likers! poshmark has a feature where you can send offers directly to likers
1851_1,1, the offer has to be at least 10% lower than your price and include a shipping discount
1852_1,1,utilize social media
1853_1,1," i created an instagram specifically for my poshmark, and it’s another great way to boost your account, and more importantly, make friends! mine is @ secondstopposh"
1854_1,1,so that’s my spiel on poshmark
1855_1,1, i seriously love it so much
1856_1,1,"so, it can definitely be hard to save money for your ugw, especially when it seems so far away"
1857_1,1, i did my research on some savings apps and ended up settling on digit
1858_1,1," it had the most aesthetically pleasing format, is fdic insured, allows for multiple saving goals at the same time, and has a feature that doesn’t allow your bank account to fall under a certain amount"
1859_1,1,"stay safe, stay strong, stay skinny"
1860_1,1,"hey everyone! a little bit ago, i said how i wanted you guys to give me your reasons to be skinny after i did my reasons  and i got a ton of responses, so i’m going to share them here! continue this in the comments below"
1861_1,1," i also wanted to mention that my comment section is a super safe place for you guys to talk with me or one another, have conversations, vent, whatever you need, feel free to post it there! unless it’s super offensive, i won’t take it down"
1862_1,1,looking and feeling like my real self
1863_1,1,no fat rolls rolling up on themselves when i’m trying to sleep comfortably
1864_1,1,"skinny, pretty face with a razor sharp jaw"
1865_1,1,fitting just about anywhere
1866_1,1,enjoying every bite of tiny food instead of taking eating for granted
1867_1,1,looking like a doll in winter clothes (versus looking like a rotund snowman)
1868_1,1,"stay safe, stay strong, stay skinny"
1869_1,1,my life has honestly been a whirlwind
1870_1,1," i left my friend group about a month ago, and it’s been spiraling downwards since then"
1871_1,1, i had prom last saturday and ended up going with another group
1872_1,1," it was super fun and all, until my old friends (one in particular) started a bunch of drama for no reason at all"
1873_1,1,"it was really sucky to go through at the time, but i didn’t want it to ruin my night, so i let it go"
1874_1,1," i ended up going to another friends house to party and we had edibles which was super fun, the next day my old friend texted me a bunch of nasty stuff and it really shook me up, but i got over it"
1875_1,1,"besides for that, i’ve actually been doing well! my poshmark has been poppin lately (along with my mercari, depop, and vinted) which is really awesome! i’m going sourcing this saturday which is my favorite part"
1876_1,1," if you guys want my username, contact me or shoot me a text through my kik (catyspacen) because i don’t want it linked on here, since it’s an ana blog"
1877_1,1,"stay safe, stay strong, stay skinny"
1878_1,1,hey lovelies! today i’m back with another tip post
1879_1,1," i might do another starve + sip where we can chat, and then i’ll be posting the reasons y’all sent me on why you want to be skinny! keep submitting them either through contact or by leaving a comment on this"
1880_1,1,"we all see the number dropping on the scale, but then we look in the mirror, and nothing"
1881_1,1, or a ghost of a thigh gap even though we’ve worked so hard
1882_1,1, a lot of the reason for this is because our bodies aren’t toned
1883_1,1, weights don’t solve the problem because we also don’t want to look muscular
1884_1,1,stretching
1885_1,1, a concept
1886_1,1, it really works!! i stretch every night for anywhere from 5-15 minutes
1887_1,1," i used to be a dancer, so i have a regiment to follow, but if you have no idea where to start, go to youtube and follow along to some videos"
1888_1,1,"straddle, then reach to one leg, hold"
1889_1,1, repeat
1890_1,1,"stay safe, stay strong, stay skinny"
1891_1,1,"hey everyone! sorry for not being super active lately, my life has literally been falling apart"
1892_1,1," but better motivation to not eat!! anyways, today i have a list of food and their calories! this is all based off of 100g"
1893_1,1," if you eat less, calories will be less, and vice versa"
1894_1,1,that’s all i have for today! feel free to add your own down below
1895_1,1,"stay safe, stay strong, stay skinny"
1896_1,1," soy milk contains soy, which is false estrogen and can really mess up a woman’s body"
1897_1,1, please be aware of that and i advise you to not consume much soy
1898_1,1,hey everyone! i wanted to start a new series on here that i’ll hopefully continue doing
1899_1,1," the thought behind this was to be a little series where i would just sit down and chat with you guys (while we sip our green tea, of course"
1900_1,1,so my prom is coming up
1901_1,1, literally next saturday
1902_1,1, i’m really nervous because i want to be around 105 then but idk if i can do that
1903_1,1," my plan is to fast until lunch, have a rice cake, then eat oatmeal for dinner if my parents are around"
1904_1,1," if not, i won’t eat"
1905_1,1, then i’ll water (and tea) fast the two days before prom! i’m hoping that will work
1906_1,1,i’ve also been really into poshmark lately
1907_1,1, i’ve been having so much fun running my shop
1908_1,1, i love fashion and it gives me a calming sense of purpose
1909_1,1, i went out sourcing saturday and picked up some cool pieces! my fav was a pair of j
1910_1,1,crew paperbag waist shorts
1911_1,1, i also went to plato’s and found a brandy tank and a pair of levi’s shorts
